# Generic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) for Molecular and Solid-state Materials

This model is built on top of the original CGCNN implementation: 
```bash
git@github.com:txie-93/cgcnn.git
```

The aim of this research project is to develop generic materials representations and the corresponding neural network architectures (e.g. multigraph) capable of learning the structure-property relationship in molecular and condensed-matter materials systems.
